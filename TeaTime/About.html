            <div class="historyoftea">
                <h1>The Hidden Health and Benefits of Tea</h1>
                <p>1) People all over the world have been drinking tea for thousands of centuries, and for good reason. Numerous studies have shown that a variety of teas may boost your immune system, fight off inflammation, and even ward off cancer and heart disease.                </p>
                <h1>I. Metabolism And Bioavailability</h1>
                <p>For all catechins, the metabolic pathways of methylation, The major pathway for the elimination of EGCG is the biliary excretion. The total amount of metabolites excreted in urine is associated with maximum plasma concentrations. Urinary recovery was 0.5–6% for some tea catechins [10]. The half-lives of flavanols are 2–3 h in plasma, except EGCG, which is eliminated more slowly probably due to higher biliary excretion and greater complexing with plasma proteins [11].glucuronidation and sulfation have been observed.</p>
                <h1>II. Cancer Preventive Effects Of Tea In Humans </h1>
                <p>Earliest documented cancer preventive effect of tea is our study in 1988 [12]. Currently, there are 1000 scientific publications in the scientific literature found on PubMed documenting cancer preventive ability of tea. Several studies initiated in our laboratory and subsequently verified from many other laboratories have suggested that catechins and theaflavins found in tea may reduce the risk of various types of cancers in humans. </p>
                <h1>III. Tea And Cardiovascular Diseases</h1>
                <p>Consumption of tea is increasingly being shown to be associated with enhanced cardiovascular and metabolic health. Green tea caused an increase in the activity of enzymes implicated in cellular protection against reactive oxygen species: superoxide dismutase in serum and the expression of catalase in the aorta. This action is combined with direct action on oxygen species by a decrease in the nitric oxide plasma concentration [45]. Green tea catechins affect lipid metabolism by different pathways and prevent the appearance of atherosclerotic plaque. </p>
                <h1>IV. Tea And Diabetes</h1>
                <p>Various studies have shown that tea may affect glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, causing interest in the health effects of tea consumption on diabetes. In a large cohort of U.S. middle-aged and older women from the Women’s Health Study, women who consumed more than or equal to 4 cups/day of tea had a 30% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than did those who did not consume tea [51]. In a retrospective cohort study among Japanese adults, adults who consumed more than or equal to 6 cups/day of green tea lowered their risk of diabetes by 33%, while no association with diabetes risk was found for oolong or black teas. </p>
                <h1>V. Tea And Arthritis</h1>
                <p>Few studies have reported the beneficial effects of tea against arthritic disease in humans. In a study in Britain, it was found that those who drank tea had greater bone mineral density than those who did not drink tea [55]. Coffee, tea, and caffeine consumption were evaluated as risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis onset among older women in a prospective cohort study. Compared with those reporting no use, subjects drinking more than or equal to 4 cups/day of decaffeinated coffee were at increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast.</p>
                <h1>VI. Tea And Neurological Effects</h1>
                <p>Due to lack of well-controlled clinical trials, the effect of tea in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders has not been studied on a large scale. The protective effect of EGCG against neuronal diseases may involve its radical scavenging and iron chelating activity and/or regulation of antioxidant protective enzymes. Reduced risk for Parkinson’s disease was observed for more than or equal to 2 cups/day of tea consumption and two or more cola drinks/day. The associations for tea and cola drinks were not affected by smoking or coffee consumption.</p>

            <!-- History Of tea -->
            <div class="historyoftea">
                <h1>A Brief History of Teas in India - TeaOrigin</h1>
                <p>1) Drinking tea in India has been evolving in many ways, with every region of this vast country making its own chai variants. The history of tea goes back almost 5,000 years. There are more than 3,000 different variations of tea available in the market. The most widely consumed beverage in the world has both a historical and cultural importance that cannot be rivaled.    </p>
                <p>2) The origin of tea started in China. This story goes back to ancient China, more than 5000 years ago. During the time, an Emperor by the name of Shen Nung was an herbalist. Once his servant unintentionally made an herbal mix when the leaves of a wild tree fell into the boiling water. The emperor was keen to know everything about that herbal mix as the pleasant aroma drew him to drink that mix. And that is how the tea was discovered. In China, for centuries, tea has been used as a lovely drink, herbal tonic, and various other medicinal uses.</p>
                <p>3) India is the world's one of the largest producer of tea. It was brought to India by the silk caravans that traveled from China to Europe centuries ago, though the Camellia Sinensis is also native to India, and grew in the wild long before its true worth was realized. Native Indians used the leaves as part of their diet sometimes, though mostly it was used for its medicinal properties.  </p>
                <p>4) In Assam, Nilgiri and Darjeeling, large parts of the jungle were cleared for tea production as the British established plantations to provide an alternative to expensive Chinese tea. It took a while for the Empire to develop a taste for the Assam tea they viewed as inferior, but tastes soon changed. Even in the United States (not a famed tea-drinking nation), by 1887 more Indian than Chinese tea was being consumed.  </p>

                <h1>Cultivation and harvesting  </h1>
                <p>1) Camellia sinensis is an evergreen plant that grows mainly in tropical and subtropical climates.[68] Some varieties can also tolerate marine climates and are cultivated as far north as Cornwall in England,[69] Perthshire in Scotland,[70] Washington in the United States,[71] and Vancouver Island in Canada.[72] In the Southern Hemisphere, tea is grown as far south as Hobart in Tasmania[73][74] and Waikato in New Zealand.[75]   </p>
                <p>2) Tea plants are propagated from seed and cuttings; about 4 to 12 years are needed for a plant to bear seed and about three years before a new plant is ready for harvesting.[68] In addition to a zone 8 climate or warmer, tea plants require at least 127 cm (50 in) of rainfall per year and prefer acidic soils.[76] Many high-quality tea plants are cultivated at elevations of up to 1,500 m (4,900 ft) above sea level. Though at these heights the plants grow more slowly, they acquire a better flavour.[77]                </p>
